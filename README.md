# drowsiness-detection

Road crashes and other accidents have become the common cause of fatalities and injuries in the human world. According to data from the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2015, 
nearly 1.25 million people died worldwide due to road accidents. Driver fatigue is a significant factor in many road accidents. I will be using computer vision algorithms to 
extract facial features such as eye closure and yawning, followed by machine learning techniques to effectively detect driver state. We will be comparing multiple machine learning
models and will be using the most effective one to develop a real-time drowsiness detector. This system will warn the driver if it detects a drowsy state, hence preventing any 
harm that may have been caused to the driver and the passengers otherwise.
